# Python script to generate HTML HXL hashtag dictionary

The [Humanitarian Exchange Language](http://hxlstandard.org) (HXL)
uses hashtags to add information to spreadsheets, API output, and
similar data using hashtags and attributes. The core schema defining
the hashtags and attributes is located at

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1En9FlmM8PrbTWgl3UHPF_MXnJ6ziVZFhBbojSJzBdLI/edit?usp=sharing

This script reads the core schema and uses it to generate
human-readable HTML markup for the [HXL Hashtag
Dictionary](http://hxlstandard.org/standard/dictionary/), which is
part of the HXL standard. This script is in use beginning with HXL
version 1.1.
